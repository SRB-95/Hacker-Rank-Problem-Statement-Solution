Question:
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world!
Then, the output should be:
UPPER CASE 1
LOWER CASE 9

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
bow = input("User entered:")
d={"UPPER_CASE":0 , "LOWER_CASE":0}
for char in bow:
    if char.isupper():
        d["UPPER_CASE"]+=1
    elif char.islower():
        d["LOWER_CASE"]+=1
print("UPPERER_CASE",d["UPPER_CASE"])
print("LOWER_CASE",d["LOWER_CASE"])
